2. Explore destructuring, spread/rest operators, and template literals.
3. Build a mini app that uses modules to separate logic into files.
4. ðŸ“º Recommended Video: ES6 Modules Tutorial by Academind

Practice Projects:
1. Todo App with Classes and LocalStorage
2. Weather App with Fetch and Async/Await
3. Quiz App Using Array Methods and DOM Manipulation

Resources:
- MDN Web Docs (for deep diving into any topic)
- JavaScript.info (comprehensive explanationsand exercises)
- freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

Tips:
- Donâ€™t just watchâ€”code along and tweak examples.
- Build small projects at every stage.
- Use console.log a lot to see how things work.
- Set small goals daily, and review regularly.

Once you're confident with these areas, jump back into your full stack course. Youâ€™ll see backend concepts like authentication and data handling become way easier and more intuitive.
